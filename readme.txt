## Description  
My project was a side-scrolling 2D runner with infinite, random terrain generation; bosses, enemies and obstacles; and player powerups.
I implemented collision, where enemies and projectiles colliding with the player cause the player to lose health. Enemies have different behavior and movement patterns. There are two bosses, and during boss battles, the scrolling screen and terrain generation stop until the player defeats the boss.
The goal of the game is to get a high score by destroying as many enemies as possible.
